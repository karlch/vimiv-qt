"""*Utilities to work with completion modules*.

A completion module offers a model with options for command line completion and a filter
that decides which results are filtered depending on the text in the command line. All
completion models inherit from the :class:`BaseModel` class.

A completion module must define for which command line text it is valid. In addition, it
can provide a custom filter as well as custom column widths for the results shown. By
default there is only a single column which gets the complete width. Let's start with a
simple example::

    from vimiv.api import completion

    class UselessModel(completion.BaseModel):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(":useless")  # Gets triggered when the command line text
                                          # starts with ":useless"
            data = [("useless %d" % (i),) for i in range(3)]
            self.set_data(data)

The model defined offers the completions "useless 0", "useless 1" and "useless 2" if the
command line text starts with ":useless".

Note:
    The data which was set is a sequence of tuples. The tuples are required as it is
    possible to have multiple columns in the completion widget.

To include additional information on the provided completion, further columns can be
added::

    class UselessModel(completion.BaseModel):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(":useless", column_widths=(0.7, 0.3))
            data = [("useless %d" % (i), "Integer") for i in range(3)]
            self.set_data(data)

The offered completions now provide and additional description (which is always
"Integer") that is shown in a second column next to the actual completion. The
description column is set up to take 30 % of the total width while the completion takes
70 %.

For an overview of implemented models, feel free to take a look at the ones defined in
``vimiv.completion.completionmodels``.
