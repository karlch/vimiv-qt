The Image Loading Process
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The image loading process is started by emitting the ``load_images`` signal. It is for
example emitted by the library when a new image path was selected, in thumbnail mode
upon selection or by the ``:open`` command. There are a few different cases that are
taken care of:

* Loading a single path that is already in the filelist
  In this case the filelist navigates to the appropriate index and the image is
  opened.
* Loading a single path that is not in the filelist
  The filelist is populated with all images in the same directory as this path and
  the path is opened.
* Loading multiple paths
  The filelist is populated with these paths and the first file in the list is
  opened.

To open an image the ``new_image_opened`` signal is emitted with the absolute path to
this image. This signal is accepted by the file handler in
``vimiv.imutils._file_handler`` which then loads the actual image from disk using
``QImageReader``. Once the format of the image has been determined, and a displayable Qt
widget has been created, the file handler emits one of:

* ``pixmap_loaded`` for standard images
* ``movie_loaded`` for animated Gifs
* ``svg_loaded`` for vector graphics

The image widget in ``vimiv.gui.image`` connects to these signals and displays
the appropriate Qt widget.
