.. note::

    This Qt port is the future of vimiv. New features will only be implemented here and
    there are already many improvements compared to the `gtk version
    <https://github.com/karlch/vimiv>`_. The old version is only recommended if you
    require a more stable software. In case there is anything you miss here, please
    open an `issue on github <https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/issues/>`_.

For information on how to get vimiv running take a look at
:doc:`the installation instructions <documentation/install>`. Afterwards, this
is a good place to :doc:`get started <documentation/getting_started>`.
For more information please check out the
:doc:`documentation <documentation/index>`.
