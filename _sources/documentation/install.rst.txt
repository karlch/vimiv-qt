Installation
============

This page includes instructions for installation on various platforms as well as a
manual fallback option:

.. contents:: :local:


Arch Linux
----------

The
`latest stable release <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vimiv-qt/>`_
and the
`git development version <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vimiv-qt-git/>`_
is available in the AUR.

Fedora
------

The `stable release <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vimiv-qt/>`_ is available in the Fedora repositories.
It can be installed using the standard GUI software installers (Gnome
Software/Discover/Dnfdragora) and also using `dnf`::

    $ sudo dnf install vimiv-qt

Using pip
---------

You can retrieve the latest stable release using::

    $ pip install --user vimiv

and the latest development version with::

    $ pip install --user git+https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/

.. note::

    This will not install a version of Qt or PyQt. Please install a valid combination
    as described in :ref:`dependencies <install_dependencies>`, e.g., using::

        $ pip install --user PyQt6

.. include:: datafile_warning.rst


Manual Install
--------------

First of all get the code by cloning the git repository and switch into the
repository folder::

    $ git clone https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/
    $ cd vimiv-qt

or by downloading one of the snapshots on the
`releases <https://github.com/karlch/vimiv-qt/releases>`_ page.

.. note::

   To compile the C extension, the python header files for python module development are
   required. In some distributions, e.g. Ubuntu, these are not included in the default
   python installation but another package (python-dev for Ubuntu) must be installed.

.. _install_systemwide:

System-Wide Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vimiv provides an example Makefile in the ``misc`` directory for convenience.
To install copy the Makefile into the repository directory, ``cp misc/Makefile
.``, tweak it to your liking and run (as root if installing system-wide)::

    $ make install

The list of available options can be displayed with::

    $ make options

These options are defined at the top of the Makefile and can be changed to fit
your needs. To uninstall vimiv the standard::

    $ make uninstall

should work.

.. include:: dependency_info.rst

.. include:: updating_icon_cache.rst

.. _install_using_tox:

Using Tox
^^^^^^^^^

In the repostory folder run tox to set up the virtual environment::

    $ tox -e mkvenv

This installs all needed Python dependencies and vimiv in a .venv subfolder.
You can now launch vimiv by running::

    $ .venv/bin/vimiv

You can create a wrapper script to start vimiv somewhere in your ``$PATH``,
e.g.  ``/usr/bin/vimiv`` or ``~/bin/vimiv``::

    #!/bin/sh
    ~/path/to/vimiv/.venv/bin/vimiv

.. include:: datafile_warning.rst

Running directly in the repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the repository folder build the c-extension for manipulate mode::

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

You can now launch vimiv by running::

    $ python -m vimiv

.. include:: dependency_info.rst

.. include:: datafile_warning.rst
