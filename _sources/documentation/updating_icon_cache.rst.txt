.. note::

    You may need to run ``gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor`` (replace the
    path if installing the icons somewhere else) after the install to get the vimiv icon
    in your application launcher. It has been reported that the command was needed for
    `wofi <https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi>`_.
