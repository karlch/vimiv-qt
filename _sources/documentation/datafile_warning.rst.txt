.. warning::

    This does not install data files such as the icons or the ``vimiv.desktop``
    file globally. Thus, e.g., file managers may not find the vimiv program as
    expected. To get an idea on how to install these, you can take a look at
    the Makefile located in `misc/Makefile` and read the section on
    :ref:`system-wide installation <install_systemwide>`.
